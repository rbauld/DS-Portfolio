# DS-Portfolio
A collection of projects to demonstrate various data science related skills

## Structure
Projects are separated into different folders. Most of the projects will be jupityer notebooks. This way code and results can be displayed in an easy to digest manner. Short descriptions of the projects and a list of skills demonstrated are below.
